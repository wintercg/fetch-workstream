# fetch-workstream
This is a repo to discuss the requirements of server-side runtimes wrt the WHATWG Fetch spec.

This repo does not contain a fork of the Fetch spec, and the intention is not to fork it. This is just a place where issues can be created to discuss server-side requirements and reach an understanding before opening issues upstream.
